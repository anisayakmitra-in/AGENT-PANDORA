# Release policy

Pandora uses plain SemVer tags. Existing legacy preview tags remain immutable;
new releases do not use product codenames.

The older `v2.0.0-anubis.1`, `v2.0.0-anubis.2`, and `v2.0.0-anubis.3` tags are
archived previews from an earlier naming scheme. They remain available for
history and reproducibility, but they are not the active release line or
recommended install targets.

## v2.0.0-alpha.1

This was the first CLI-only prerelease. Its shipped scope is recorded in
[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

Historical preview tags are retained as immutable compatibility references and
are not the active release line.

It provides the CLI-first foundation:

- Parliament, Shadow Council, Domain Harness, Gene, and governed execution contracts.
- One-shot effect permits, receipts, policy decisions, and workspace-scoped executors.
- A coding Domain Harness with bounded read, search, patch, verify, and review operations.
- Provider manifests, bounded model requests, OpenAI-compatible HTTP transport, tool-call validation, and structured-output repair.
- Windows, macOS, and Linux CI, repository validation, dependency auditing, and release-build checks.

The preview is not a stable release and does not claim desktop support. Native
release artifacts are valid only when the tagged release workflow has
completed and its checksums, signature, SBOM, and provenance assets are
present.

## v2.0.0-alpha.2

This is the current CLI-only prerelease. It carries the provider, session,
configuration, launcher, and CI improvements listed in
[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). The public command name remains `pandora`, and
the npm/Bun package name is `pandora-agent`.

The release remains a prerelease and does not claim desktop, mobile, remote,
or marketplace support. Native artifacts are valid only when the tagged
release workflow has completed and its checksums, signature, SBOM, and
provenance assets are present.

## Version rules

- Patch releases (`v2.0.x`) fix regressions without changing the public contract.
- Minor releases (`v2.x.0`) add compatible capabilities within the current release line.
- Major releases change the public contract and increment the major version.
- Prereleases use `-alpha.N`, `-beta.N`, or `-rc.N` suffixes.
- Release tags are immutable. Each release must publish notes, checksums, an SBOM, supported-platform results, and rollback instructions.
- A release is not considered stable until local and GitHub checks pass on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
