# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Agent sessions now persist a bounded user, assistant, and tool transcript and
  reuse it when `run --agent --session <id>` continues a task.
- Approved agent runs can resume a pending tool call with its session and
  approval ID; the approval is consumed once through the governed runtime.
- Transcript records retain tool-call structure, reject stored system-message
  overrides, and use private session-database permissions where supported.

## v2.0.0-alpha.1

This is the first plain-SemVer Pandora Agent CLI prerelease.

### Shipped

- Parliament, Shadow Council, Harness, and Gene contracts with one governed execution path.
- Reference-monitor permits, one-shot approvals, effect receipts, and workspace-scoped executors.
- Coding Domain Harness operations for reading, searching, reviewing, patching, and verification.
- Bounded agent mode with strict tool schemas, turn and tool budgets, provider continuation, and session events.
- OpenAI-compatible provider configuration, connectivity testing, structured-output validation, and repair handling.
- SQLite-backed sessions, configuration migration, shell completions, diagnostics, verified updates, rollback, and uninstall.
- Native CLI release workflow for Windows x64, Linux x64, and macOS Intel and Apple Silicon.
- Checksum verification, optional Cosign verification, SPDX SBOM generation, and GitHub build provenance.

### Scope

- This prerelease supports the CLI only.
- Read-only work can run without approval. Filesystem writes and verification processes require an exact approval before execution.
- Skills are local, disabled by default, and cannot execute scripts outside the governed ToolEngine path.
- Desktop, mobile, remote execution, and marketplace clients are outside this release.

This release is a prerelease. Its native artifacts are valid only when the tagged
release workflow and its platform checks have completed successfully.
