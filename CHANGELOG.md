# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Provider profiles can use one validated fallback profile for recoverable
  credential, transport, timeout, rate-limit, and server failures.
- `pandora setup --interactive` provides bounded first-run provider setup
  without ever collecting or storing an API-key value.

## v2.0.0-alpha.2

This prerelease updates the CLI foundation without changing the governed
execution model.

### Shipped

- Named provider profiles with one-run provider selection and isolated
  credential environment-variable names.
- Bounded agent transcripts with session resume and one-shot continuation of
  approved pending actions.
- Atomic private configuration writes that preserve the previous valid file on
  replacement failure.
- A public `pandora-agent` npm/Bun launcher that safely replaces stale cached
  binaries on Windows and forwards to verified native artifacts.
- GitHub Actions workflows refreshed to current action runtimes for the
  Windows, macOS, and Linux release checks.

This release remains CLI-only and is a prerelease. Native artifacts are valid
only when the tagged release workflow and its checksums, signature, SBOM, and
provenance assets are present.

## v2.0.0-alpha.1

This is the first plain-SemVer Pandora Agent CLI prerelease.

### Shipped

- Parliament, Shadow Council, Harness, and Gene contracts with one governed execution path.
- Reference-monitor permits, one-shot approvals, effect receipts, and workspace-scoped executors.
- Coding Domain Harness operations for reading, searching, reviewing, patching, and verification.
- Bounded agent mode with strict tool schemas, turn and tool budgets, provider continuation, and session events.
- OpenAI-compatible provider configuration, connectivity testing, structured-output validation, and repair handling.
- SQLite-backed sessions, configuration migration, shell completions, diagnostics, verified updates, rollback, and uninstall.
- Native CLI release workflow for Windows x64, Linux x64, and macOS Intel and Apple Silicon.
- Checksum verification, optional Cosign verification, SPDX SBOM generation, and GitHub build provenance.

### Scope

- This prerelease supports the CLI only.
- Read-only work can run without approval. Filesystem writes and verification processes require an exact approval before execution.
- Skills are local, disabled by default, and cannot execute scripts outside the governed ToolEngine path.
- Desktop, mobile, remote execution, and marketplace clients are outside this release.

This release is a prerelease. Its native artifacts are valid only when the tagged
release workflow and its platform checks have completed successfully.
